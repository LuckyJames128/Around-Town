## Controls, game notes
- Left, Right, Up arrow keys for movement
- Down key to initiate dialogue, Space to continue dialogue

- Some NPC's have game-necessary quests
  - These are marked with an exclamation point over their head

- We planned to have more features, but we were unable to make all of our ideas a reality with the 48h time limit
## Code notes
- We are aware that our code is not well organized and is unfortunately difficult to slog through
- This was the first time the 4 of us worked as a team and the first time using Godot 4.4.
- This, along with several communication issues, led the code to look like this

- It runs correctly though so that's pretty cool (note: not rn but hopefully when we submit)
